Static HTML, LESS and JS for the new Manta Matcher page. The page uses harp, a static web server with built-in preprocessing. See http://harpjs.com/ for more information. It's installed as a npm module, and run using ``harp server public`` from the command line at the root folder.

The page is hosted using github pages. Run the ``build.sh`` script to publish a new version.
